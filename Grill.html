    <h1>Grill How-To</h1>
    <h2>Starting/Propane</h2>
    <p>The house comes included with a gas grill (no tank needed). The propane gas comes from the large tank located under the
        outside stairs leading to the pool, so before started the grill, you must open the propane line. There are two switches
        that control gas flow to the grill and they are located on the deck post beside the grill.</p>
    <br>
    <p> 1. The main switch is a inline petcock valve (bottom) for On & Off. When the valve is vertical (up/down) gas is on and
        should be available to the grill. When the valve is horizontal (left/right) the gas is shut off and the grill will
        not be able to ignite. **Note: this valve can only be turned ‘¼’ turn and should be turned on first. </p>
    <p> 2. For safety purposes a timer switch is also installed (top) to prevent leaving gas flowing to the grill. Turn the knob
        to the right to start the gas flow to the grill. You will hear a ticking sound like a clock that tells you the knob
        is on. </p>
    <br>
    <p>To Start: Turn the petcock valve vertical and turn the timer switch to the right. Ignite the grill.</p>
    <p>To Stop: Turn all grill knobs to off, turn of the time switch back to the left (you will hear the ticking stop), turn
        the petcock valve horizontally.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: If the grill stops working while cooking, it is probably due to the timer switch not set for long enough time.
        Turn the switch to the right for more time and reignite the grill.</p>
